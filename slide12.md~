# Common IDE Examples (IV)
# Eclipse Debugging
***
* ##### Code can be configured to pause execution at a user defined breakpoint associated with a line of source code
* ##### Values of variables can be checked or even changed while code is "paused" during execution
* ##### Execution can also be "stepped" though 1 line at a time including after a breakpoint is reached
	* ##### helps pinpoint where faults occur without having to look at assembly code
