*  Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) come in many varieties. On a high level, an IDE is a software application that facilitates software development by combining or streamlining different parts of a software tool chain. 
*  IDEs usually consist of build tools, code editing tools and debugging tools and use a grapical user interface. 
*  IDEs exist for multiple langages and for specific languages and platforms.
*  Many IDEs are opensource or are given away freely to by the proprietory of the platforms/languages they are used for. Not all IDEs are open source.
