# 
# IDEs History/Background (I)
# 
# 
### Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) come in many varieties. On a high level, an IDE is a software application that facilitates software development by combining or streamlining different parts of a software tool chain. 
### IDEs usually consist of build tools, code editing tools and debugging tools and use a grapical user interface. 
### IDEs exist for multiple langages and for specific languages and platforms.
### Many IDEs are opensource or are given away freely to by the proprietory of the platforms/languages they are used for. Not all IDEs are open source.
# 
# 
# IDEs History/Background (II)
# 
# 
### Development of the first IDEs first started in the 1980s. Arguably the first true IDE was created and released in 1983. 
### TurboPascal was written by Anders Hejlsberg featured and integrated an editor and complile for the Pascal programming language.
### Although it was not open source, the program was reasonably priced ($50) and greatly streamlined the process of tracing back error messages to source code. 
# 
# 
# IDEs History/Background (II)
# 
# 
### The first IDEs with graphical user interfaces were developed in the 1990. This shift in development was largely due to the popularity of the windows operating system. 
### Visual Basic (VB) was the first graphical IDE and launched in 1991
### Originally VB only supported the BASIC language but quickly added support for Java and C++. 
### Delphi annd Visual Cafe were other IDEs released at around the same time as VB, but Microsofts Visual Basic remained the domainte IDE in the 1990's
# 
# 
# IDEs History/Background (III)
# 
# 
### IDEs begain supporting the building of applications from pre-fabricated objects which helped especially with the concurret development of the web 
### This practice developed into what is now called visual programming which allows the creation of programs at a higher level of abstraction using blocks and flowcharts.
### This style of programming is often based on the Unified Modeling Language. Popular enviornments that use visual programming include LabView and Simulink software.
# 
# 
# IDEs History/Background (IV)
# 
# 
### Modern IDE often have features including 
* ### Version Control -- Most version control systems including GIT and Mercurial can be set up to work with an IDE to track changes and give update repositories. There are even tools that can automate the merging of repositories according to user defined rules
* ### Continous Building/Testing -- Specific IDEs and plugins exist that enforce continous integration and other practices that software life cycles demand.
* ### Cloud Computing Tools --  Athough it is a relatively new development in software, full featured cloud dedicated IDEs exist and including Cloud9
* ### Visual GUI builders -- For platform specific IDEs such as android and ios development toolkits, these tools are essential for testing platform compatability
### Multiplatform IDEs can often use plugins to mimic the functionality of more specified IDEs

# IDE Benifits and Drawbacks (I)
# 
# 
### Many argue that the rise of the use of IDEs have both democratized programming and enabled bad programming  
* ### Reduced the "Barrier to Entry" decreasing the amount of time running obscure compiler commands.
* ### "Dumbed down" software programming by causing bad programming habbits.
### Many still believe the beinfits of IDEs outweight the drawbacks
* ### IDEs help everyone. "Great Programmers get greater, bad programmers get better"
 
# 
# 
# IDE Benifits and Drawbacks (II)
# 
# 
### The main advantages that IDEs offer are to make development faster and easier, though there are other benifits as well.
* ### Project Managment: IDEs are essential for keeping large software projects organized. This is especially true for open source projects which often feature 1000s of individual contributions which all need to work together.
* ### Administrating company practices and standards: Certain life cycles require practices that are difficult to follow consistenly. Integrated Development Environments can can be taylored to enforce the steps of a specific software development process with regards to testing, iterating etc. They can also help standardize how code is commented and documented.

# 
# 
# IDE Benifits and Drawbacks (III)
# 
# 
### Saying that IDEs encourage "lazy" programming is not necessarily a strong drawback. Other potential problems include
* ### Learning Curve -- IDEs are complicated tools and becoming proficent with and IDE requires a significant time investment. 
* ### Some IDEs are specific to certain systems which limits where a code can be developed. IDEs also take up a lot of space, which can limit where they can be used, though this is not as large an issue anymore
* ### IDEs can become outdated if a certain library or code base is changed by a third party. Keeping an IDE updated and the most recent packages installed is time consuming.


# 
# 
# Common IDE Examples (I)
# Eclipse
# 
* ### #1 most searched for IDE on google accounting for ~30% of all searches [3] 
* ### Originally developed with IBM transitioned to an open source software in 2001
* ### Primarily Java base but is adaptable to run with all major languages (C, Python, Fortran, etc.) and even some commercial softwares such as mathematica
